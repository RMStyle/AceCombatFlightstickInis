# Ace Combat Flight Stick Inis
A collection of flight sticks inis for ace combat 7. Feel free to add new sticks here.

This project was made because I could not find the [Steam Discussion with the ini for my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro](https://steamcommunity.com/app/502500/discussions/0/1754646027384418458/). 

# How to use
## Windows
Open the File Explorer and go to `%AppData%\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\Config`. Open the file `Input.ini` and add this below the [JoystickMappingFormat] section.
## Linux
Inside the SteamLibrary directory navigate to `steamapps/compatdata/502500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment/ACE COMBAT 7/Config`. Open the file `Input.ini` and add this below the [JoystickMappingFormat] section.
