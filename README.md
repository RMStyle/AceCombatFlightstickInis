# Ace Combat Flight Stick Inis
A collection of flight sticks inis for ace combat 7. Feel free to add new sticks here.

This project was made because I could not find the [Steam Discussion with the ini for my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro](https://steamcommunity.com/app/502500/discussions/0/1754646027384418458/). This project is only possible due to steam users sharing their configs, so I added a sources file. Feel free to visit the discussion and leave behind a thanks!

Most configs are not tested by me, due to not having the required equipment. But they should at least give you a good base to work with.

# How to use
## Windows
Open the File Explorer and go to `%AppData%\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\Config`. 
Make a backup of the `Input.ini`, by copying it and renaming it to `Input.ini.bak`. If anything goes wrong the ini can just be renamed to the original name and changes are reverted, 
Open the file `Input.ini` and add this below the [JoystickMappingFormat] section.
